## Main libraries covered:
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/index.html): low-level plotting
- [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/): high-level, grammar of graphics plotting
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): (2D) DataFrames (note that the [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format has no problem storing N-dimensional data in a 2D table
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/): N-dimensional arrays, core data science library
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): simple library for sophisticated machine learning on nSamples x nFeatures matrices
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html): stats, signal processing, ...
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): high-performance tensor operations on CPU/GPU that facilitate Deep Learning

## Other libraries referenced during session:
- [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/): labeled N-dimensional array (think ND DataFrame)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): grammar of graphics (inspired) plotting built on matplotlib
- [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about-plotnine.html): true grammar of graphics plotting built on matplotlib
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): most popular Deep Learning library from 2016-2018; [most new research is done in PyTorch](https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/)


## misc topics:
- Optional typing: a best-practice for improving documentation and future-proofing your python code. See [nice overview here](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/)
- quick overview on [managing jobs from shell](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-the-job-control-commands-in-linux-bg-fg-and-ctrlz/)
