# CNJCx: Practical Python
## The Eponym Session
### Week 5 Recap

This week we learn how to perform data analysis, data munging, and more! The best way to learn this content is to check out the recording on the [CNJCx website][cnjcx_link], and follow along with [this week's notebook](cnjcx_week5_practical_python.ipynb).

**Session Leaders**: Tyler Benster

Session Recording at [**CNJCx webpage**](https://stanford-cnjc.github.io/#/CNJCx) under the Week 5 session materials.

## Preparation

If you havn't attended regularly you'll need:
 - to get python3 using the [preparation materials for week 3][python3_link],
 - and to make a [virtual environment][env_link] for CNJCx (covered in week 3). 

## Running the Notebook

This only takes a few commands. Tyler outlined them for you in the notebook, but we've transcribed them for you here... _this is a bit of a :hatching_chick: problem. :satisfied:_

Open your terminal and run these commands. 

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/cnjcx/code && cd $_
$ git clone https://github.com/stanford-cnjc/cnjcx-course-materials.git
$ cd cnjcx-course-materials/week5_practical
$ source ~/cnjcx_env/bin/activate # or activate the env you'd rather use
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter notebook # if your browser doesn't automatically open you can navigate to the provided link
```

**Note:** If any commands are unfamiliar to you, please take a look at [the past weeks][ow_link]
